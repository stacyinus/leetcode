My Experience:

Zillow :
1.Find duplicated URL:
Given a file (size is huge) with urls. How do you find a duplicated ones?

2.Given a directory, find all the duplicated files in this directory(including all it’s sub directories)
Follow up: how do you improve you function to avoid reading all files.

3.Find all primes that is smaller than a given number n.

4. 1) Black Jack. 
     2)Tic tac toe (no coding ,just design the best data structure to store the board, note here the board is huge, so I don’t think a 2D array is good)

3.	Fibinacci (DP solution, O(1) space)
