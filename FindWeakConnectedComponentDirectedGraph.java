/*
Find the Weak Connected Component in the Directed Graph

Find the number Weak Connected Component in the directed graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors. 
(a connected set of a directed graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by direct edge path.)

Example
Given graph:

A----->B  C
 \     |  | 
  \    |  |
   \   |  |
    \  v  v
     ->D  E <- F
Return {A,B,D}, {C,E,F}. Since there are two connected component which are {A,B,D} and {C,E,F}
